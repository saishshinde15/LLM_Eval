# LLM Evaluation Projects Repository

Welcome to the **LLM Evaluation** repository! This repository contains various projects focused on evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) using **lm-evaluation-harness** and other benchmarking tools. These projects aim to measure model performance across multiple datasets and evaluation metrics.

## 📌 Repository Overview
This repository includes scripts, configurations, and methodologies for systematically assessing LLMs. Each project is documented with setup instructions and usage guidelines.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup
To run the evaluation projects, follow these steps:

### 🖥️ Local Setup (if VS Code or local setup is present)
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saishshinde15/LLM_Eval.git
   cd LLM_Eval
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run an Evaluation**
   - Navigate to the specific evaluation script and follow the instructions in its README.

### ☁️ Running Jupyter Notebooks on Google Colab (if no local setup is present)
For evaluation projects containing Jupyter notebooks, you can run them on Google Colab:

1. Open the GitHub repository in your browser.
2. Navigate to the desired Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file).
3. Click on the "Open in Colab" button (or manually open it by replacing `github.com` with `colab.research.google.com/github/` in the URL).
4. Run the notebook in Colab without needing local setup.
